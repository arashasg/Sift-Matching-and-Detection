# Sift-Matching-and-Detection
## Rotate Picture(Affine Transform.py
We have pictures of a bunch of objects (files obj1.jpg, obj2.jpg, â€¦, obj9.jpg ). We wanted to
find out if the object exists in the scene image (file scene.jpg ). The
algorithm is to find the matched feature points between each object and the scene
image(using Sift Algorithm). If the number of good matches is greater than a certain threshold (e.g. 30
matches) we decided that the object is present in the scene.
